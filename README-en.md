Simple React Project developed as an Interview's Step.

The graphic instructions could be found at the following link:

## Instructions
Develop a simple filp-card widget that shows the current weather conditions based on user's location.

**Side A of the flip-card:**

1. Current weather conditions resume (ex: Cloudy, Rainy, Sunny, etc. As the API returns it to you)
2. Icon/Graphic representation of the current weather conditions 
(ex: Sun covered by a cloud for "Cloudy", Cloud with the Rain for "Rainy", etc),
3. Current Temperature (in Celsius)
4. Closer address based on user's location
5. Humidity percentage
6. Week days

**Lato B della flip-card:**
1. A Map that shows the current user position

####The user should have the possibility to flip the card

## Technical Notes
1. Use the APIs that you like (ex: [Weatherbit API](https://www.weatherbit.io/api) and the [Maps APIs](https://bit.ly/37lQG04))
2. Try to not use external libraries or plugins to do the exercise, you can use React
3. For the CSS you can use (if you want) the pre-processor that you like (not CSS-in-JS)
4. Try to use the best practices regards the modularity. Think like this widget could be part of a bigger project
5. You can find the icons as assets in the invision's inspector
6. Make it run on [codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/)
7. When you've done upload it on GitHub and add the Sandbox link
8. On the mock-up you'll fin only the A side of the flip-card. On the B side you can just put the map on.
